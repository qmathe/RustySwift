# For building the release versions:
# $ cargo build --release --target=x86_64-apple-darwin
# $ cargo build --release --target=aarch64-apple-darwin 
# $ cargo build --release --target=aarch64-apple-ios
#
# The output libraries are located in rusty/target/x86_64-apple-darwin,  
# rusty/target/aarch64-apple-darwin and rusty/target/aarch64-apple-ios
#
# In Xcode, we pass -lrusty to Other Linker Flags and point Library Search Paths to different 
# directories depending on Platform and Architecture in Release config. In this way, we don't  
# link a specific static library as usually done with Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries.
